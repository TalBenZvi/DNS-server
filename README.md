# DNS-server
Maps domain names to IP adresses
<br>
- The server recieves a domain as input and sends the corresponding IP adress as output
- Input and output sent using UDP, not the command line
- Known IP adresses saved in a text file as well as a TTL
- If the server can't find an IP adress it will ask it's parent server
